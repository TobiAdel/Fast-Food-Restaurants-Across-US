# Fast-Food-Restaurants-Across-US
Anonymous Gophers- Group 4/Project 1

#Project Description:
As a group, we wanted to know about the fast food chains in the US. We were interested to know the most
popular restaurants based on our sample size. Furthermore, we looked into how the location of the restaurant
affected the user rating and if the restaurants are more prevalent within the city.

looking to go into franchising. This also gives good data what kind of fastfood chain has the best customer
service.
